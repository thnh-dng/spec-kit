# Knowledge Base Maintenance Guide for Spec Kit

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for maintaining a healthy, consistent, and valuable knowledge base throughout the Spec Kit workflow.

## Overview

A well-maintained knowledge base is the foundation of effective knowledge-driven development. This guide outlines the strategies, processes, and best practices for keeping your knowledge base accurate, consistent, and valuable throughout the project lifecycle.

## Knowledge Base Maintenance Philosophy

### **Progressive Enrichment**
Knowledge becomes more concrete and valuable as you progress through the Spec Kit workflow. The key is to enrich the knowledge base at strategic points when information becomes more definitive.

### **Consistency First**
Maintain consistency across all knowledge artifacts to ensure reliable query results and trustworthy insights.

### **Quality over Quantity**
Focus on high-quality, well-structured knowledge entries rather than voluminous but disorganized information.

## Strategic Enrichment Points

### **Phase 1: Foundation (After Constitution)**
```bash
# Ingest foundational documents
/kb-ingest "project-charter.md"
/kb-ingest "stakeholder-requirements.md"
/kb-ingest "business-objectives.md"

# Establish project context
/kb-ingest_spec """
Project Context:
Name: [Project Name]
Type: [Project Type]
Domain: [Business Domain]
Key Stakeholders: [List]
Primary Objectives: [List]
Constraints: [List]
"""
```

### **Phase 2: Requirements Analysis (After Review-Spec)**
```bash
# /review-spec automatically enriches knowledge base with:
# - Extracted entities and relationships
# - Business rules and constraints
# - Domain patterns and similarities
# - Analysis results and insights

# Manual enrichment of analysis results
/kb-ingest "specs/complex-requirements-analysis-[timestamp]/analysis-results.md"
