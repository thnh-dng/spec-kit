# Event Storming Model Update Strategy

This document provides a comprehensive strategy for maintaining and updating the "big" Event Storming domain model as feature-level Event Storming sessions uncover new insights and refinements.

## Overview

The two-tier Event Storming approach (big model + feature-level models) requires a systematic update strategy to ensure the overall domain model remains consistent, complete, and valuable. This strategy defines how feature-level insights flow back into and enhance the big domain model.

## Update Strategy Philosophy

### **Progressive Refinement**
The big domain model should evolve and improve as each feature is analyzed in detail. Feature-level Event Storming sessions uncover nuances, edge cases, and implementation details that enhance the overall domain understanding.

### **Bidirectional Knowledge Flow**
- **Top-Down**: Big model provides context and boundaries for feature analysis
- **Bottom-Up**: Feature analysis provides detailed insights that refine the big model

### **Consistency Maintenance**
All updates must maintain consistency across the entire domain model while preserving the integrity of both the big picture and feature-specific details.

## Update Triggers

### **Automatic Update Triggers**
After each feature-level Event Storming session, trigger updates when:
- **New domain events** are discovered that affect the big model
- **New aggregates** are identified that expand the domain
- **Business rules** are refined or discovered
- **Integration points** are identified that affect multiple features
- **Entity relationships** are clarified or expanded

### **Manual Update Triggers**
Consider manual updates when:
- **Cross-feature patterns** are identified
- **Domain boundaries** need adjustment
- **Stakeholder feedback** suggests model improvements
- **Implementation challenges** reveal domain model issues
- **Business requirements** change significantly

## Update Process Flow

### **Step 1: Feature Analysis Completion**
```bash
# After feature-level Event Storming completes
/agent event-storming-agent (feature-level)

# Feature results are automatically ingested
/kb-ingest "features/[feature-name]/event-storming-results.md"
```

### **Step 2: Big Model Analysis**
```bash
# Query big model for relevant context
/kb-query "big event storming domain events"
/kb-query "big event storming aggregates"
/kb-query "big event storming bounded contexts"

# Identify relationships and overlaps
/kb-query "relationship between [feature] and big domain model"
/kb-query "overlap between feature events and domain events"
/kb-query "new entities discovered for [feature]"
```

### **Step 3: Change Identification**
```bash
# Systematic change detection
/kb-query "potential big model updates from [feature]"
/kb-query "new domain events to add to big model"
/kb-query "aggregate refinements needed"
/kb-query "business rule updates required"
/kb-query "integration points to document"
```

### **Step 4: Impact Assessment**
```bash
# Assess impact on other features
/kb-query "impact of [feature] changes on other features"
/kb-query "affected features by domain model updates"
/kb-query "consistency issues across features"

# Assess impact on implementation
/kb-query "implementation impact of domain model changes"
/kb-query "refactoring needed due to model changes"
```

### **Step 5: Update Implementation**
```bash
# Apply updates to big model
/kb-ingest_spec """

# Validate consistency across all models
/kb-query "consistency validation after [feature] updates"
/kb-query "cross-feature consistency check"
/kb-query "business rule consistency validation"
/kb-query "entity relationship consistency check"
```

### **Step 7: Stakeholder Review**

## Conclusion

The Event Storming Model Update Strategy provides a systematic approach to maintaining and enhancing the big domain model as feature-level analysis uncovers new insights. This strategy ensures that:

1. **Domain Model Improves Continuously**: The big model gets better with each feature analysis
2. **Consistency Is Maintained**: All updates maintain consistency across the domain
3. **Knowledge Flows Bidirectionally**: Both top-down and bottom-up knowledge flow
4. **Stakeholders Stay Aligned**: Regular updates keep stakeholders aligned
5. **Implementation Benefits**: Better domain models lead to better implementations

By following this strategy, teams can maintain a living, breathing domain model that serves as a valuable asset throughout the project lifecycle and beyond.
