## Knowledge Base Integration
This project leverages the Knowledge Agent MCP server for:
- **Domain Intelligence**: Existing entities, relationships, and business rules
- **Implementation Patterns**: Proven approaches from similar projects
- **Quality Assurance**: Cross-artifact consistency and validation
- **Continuous Learning**: Knowledge grows with each feature implementation

## MCP-Enhanced Workflow
All commands in this project include:

2. **Knowledge ingestion**: Contribute new insights back to knowledge base
3. **Pattern recognition**: Identify and apply proven approaches
4. **Consistency validation**: Ensure cross-feature alignment
