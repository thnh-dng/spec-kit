# Knowledge-Driven Spec Kit Workflow

This document outlines the optimal integration of Knowledge Base MCP and Event Storming Agent within the Spec Kit workflow to maintain consistent knowledge enrichment throughout the specification process.

## Overview

The Knowledge-Driven Spec Kit Workflow leverages intelligent knowledge management to enhance specification quality, accelerate development, and maintain domain consistency across projects. The workflow strategically uses Knowledge Base MCP for pattern recognition and knowledge accumulation, while employing Event Storming Agent for domain modeling and business process visualization.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Progressive Knowledge Enrichment**
- Build knowledge incrementally throughout the workflow
- Enrich at key decision points when data becomes more concrete
- Maintain knowledge consistency across artifacts

### 2. **Strategic Integration Points**
- Query knowledge before creating new specifications
- Enrich knowledge after clarification and analysis steps
- Use knowledge to inform technical decisions

### 3. **Domain-First Approach**
- Understand business complexity through Event Storming
- Translate domain models into technical specifications
- Maintain business context throughout implementation

## Integrated Workflow

### Phase 1: Foundation & Knowledge Seeding

#### Step 1: Project Constitution
```bash
/constitution
```

**Knowledge Integration:**
- Ingest project charter and governance documents
- Establish initial domain boundaries
- Set knowledge base context for the project

```bash
# Ingest foundational documents
/kb-ingest "project-charter.md"
/kb-ingest "stakeholder-requirements.md"
/kb-ingest "business-objectives.md"
```

#### Step 2: Initial Knowledge Seeding
```bash
# Query for similar existing patterns
/kb-query "similar projects in e-commerce domain"
/kb-query "common architectural patterns for [project-type]"

# Ingest relevant domain knowledge
/kb-ingest "domain-overview.md"
/kb-ingest "existing-system-documentation.md"
/kb-ingest "integration-points.md"
```

### Phase 2: Requirements Analysis & Knowledge Enrichment

#### Step 3: Complex Requirements Analysis (when applicable)
```bash
/review-spec "complex-requirements-document.md"
```

**Knowledge Integration:**
- **Pre-analysis**: Automatically queries similar domains and patterns
- **During analysis**: Extracts entities, relationships, and business rules
- **Post-analysis**: Ingests analysis results and domain insights

**Automatic Knowledge Enrichment:**
```bash
# /review-spec automatically:
# 1. Queries knowledge base for similar domains
# 2. Extracts entities and relationships
# 3. Identifies business rules and constraints
# 4. Ingests analysis results
```

#### Step 4: Domain Modeling with Event Storming (for complex domains)
```bash
/agent event-storming-agent
```

**When to use Event Storming:**
- Projects with >50 requirements or multiple features
- Enterprise applications with complex business domains
- Systems requiring multiple bounded contexts
- Projects with integration points between business domains

**Input Preparation for Event Storming:**
```bash
# Query knowledge base for domain context
/kb-query "existing business processes"
/kb-query "key stakeholders and actors"
/kb-query "external system integrations"

# Prepare structured domain description
/kb-ingest_spec """
Domain: E-commerce Order Processing
Key Processes: Order placement, payment processing, fulfillment, returns
Stakeholders: Customers, administrators, suppliers, shipping partners
Integrations: Payment gateway, inventory system, shipping API
Business Rules: Inventory validation, payment authorization, shipping rules
"""
```

**Event Storming Output Integration:**
```bash
# Ingest Event Storming results
/kb-ingest "event-storming-diagram.drawio"
/kb-ingest "bounded-contexts.md"
/kb-ingest "domain-events.md"
/kb-ingest "business-processes.md"
```

### Phase 3: Specification with Knowledge Support

#### Step 5: Pre-Specification Knowledge Query
```bash
# Query for existing patterns and similar features
/kb-query "similar features to [feature-description]"
/kb-query "implementation patterns for [feature-type]"
/kb-query "existing entities related to [domain]"
/kb-query "business rules affecting [feature]"
```

#### Step 6: Feature Specification
```bash
/specify "feature-description-with-context"
```

**Knowledge-Informed Specification:**
- Leverages existing patterns and entities
- References business rules from knowledge base
- Maintains consistency with domain models
- Incorporates lessons from similar implementations

#### Step 7: Post-Specification Knowledge Enrichment
```bash
# Ingest new specification knowledge
/kb-ingest "specs/[feature-name]/spec.md"

# Extract and ingest key entities and relationships
/kb-ingest_spec """
New Feature: [feature-name]
Key Entities: [list-of-entities]
Business Rules: [list-of-rules]
Integration Points: [list-of-integrations]
Dependencies: [list-of-dependencies]
"""
```

### Phase 4: Clarification & Refinement

#### Step 8: Structured Clarification
```bash
/clarify
```

**Knowledge Integration:**
- Query knowledge base for related ambiguities
- Reference existing business rules and constraints
- Leverage domain models for context

#### Step 9: Post-Clarification Knowledge Update
```bash
# Ingest clarification results
/kb-ingest "specs/[feature-name]/clarification-results.md"

# Update entities and relationships based on clarification
/kb-ingest_spec """
Clarified Entities: [updated-entity-list]
Resolved Rules: [clarified-business-rules]
Additional Constraints: [new-constraints]
Integration Details: [clarified-integrations]
"""
```

### Phase 5: Planning & Implementation

#### Step 10: Knowledge-Informed Planning
```bash
# Query for implementation patterns
/kb-query "implementation approaches for [technology-stack]"
/kb-query "similar implementations across projects"
/kb-query "common pitfalls for [feature-type]"

/plan "feature-implementation"
```

#### Step 11: Task Generation
```bash
/tasks
```

#### Step 12: Implementation with Continuous Learning
```bash
/implement
```

**Knowledge Integration During Implementation:**
```bash
# Query for specific implementation patterns
/kb-query "[specific-technical-problem] solutions"
/kb-query "best practices for [technology-or-framework]"

# Document implementation insights
/kb-ingest "implementation-notes.md"
/kb-ingest "lessons-learned.md"
/kb-ingest "performance-optimization-notes.md"
```

### Phase 6: Analysis & Consistency

#### Step 13: Cross-Artifact Analysis
```bash
/analyze
```

**Knowledge Integration:**
- Query knowledge base for consistency patterns
- Identify conflicts with existing business rules
- Validate against domain models

#### Step 14: Post-Analysis Knowledge Update
```bash
# Ingest analysis results and fixes
/kb-ingest "analysis-results.md"
/kb-ingest "consistency-fixes.md"

# Update knowledge base with resolved conflicts
/kb-ingest_spec """
Resolved Conflicts: [list-of-conflicts]
Consistency Improvements: [list-of-improvements]
Validation Rules: [new-validation-rules]
"""
```

## Knowledge Base Maintenance Strategy

### 1. **Consistent Update Points**

#### **After Each Major Workflow Step**
1. **After `/review-spec`**: Ingest analysis results and extracted entities
2. **After Event Storming**: Add domain models and business processes
3. **After `/specify`**: Include new specifications and feature details
4. **After `/clarify`**: Update with clarified requirements and resolved ambiguities
5. **After `/plan`**: Add architectural decisions and technical approaches
6. **After `/analyze`**: Include consistency analysis and improvements
7. **After implementation**: Document lessons learned and implementation patterns

#### **Quality Assurance Checkpoints**
```bash
# Regular knowledge base health checks
/kb-stats
/kb-schema

# Validate knowledge consistency
/kb-query "conflicting patterns in [domain]"
/kb-query "duplicate entities or relationships"

# Monitor knowledge growth trends
/kb-query "knowledge base growth by domain"
```

#### **Effective Query Patterns**
```bash
# Good queries (specific and contextual)
/kb-query "user authentication patterns in microservices architecture"
/kb-query "payment processing integration with Stripe API"
/kb-query "error handling strategies for REST APIs"

# Bad queries (too vague)
/kb-query "authentication"
/kb-query "payment"
/kb-query "error handling"
```
